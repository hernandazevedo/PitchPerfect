# PitchPerfect

## Project Overview
You will make an iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

## Why this project?
The first step in becoming an iOS Developer is to create your first app! Pitch Perfect provides a substantial, while not overly complicated, introduction to the iOS ecosystem.

## What will I learn?
You will learn how to:

Create a new project from existing iOS app templates
Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device
Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code
Why is this project meaningful to my career?
MVC is the cornerstone of all iOS app development; understanding these principles early sets you on the path to success. Learning how to find answers to development questions by searching documentation emulates the practice of expert software engineers.

You will also make a relevant project that you will feel proud to share with your friends, family, and peers.

## Project Submission
Create an iPhone app that records a conversation with you and a friend and plays it back with different audio effects!

## How Do I Complete this Project?
Note: All submitted projects must compile in Xcode's most up-to-date, stable release, which is currently: Xcode 10.1 and Swift 4.2.1.

1. If you wish you may [download an example](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pitch-perfect-portfolio-app/id987684705?mt=8) of the app. 
2. Review the [grading rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3082218740/rubric) to see how your project will be assessed. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
3. If desired, download a collection of images used in the app. These can be found in the Resources section.
4. If necessary, take [Intro to iOS App Development with Swift](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud585), which walks you step-by-step through creating the Pitch Perfect App.
